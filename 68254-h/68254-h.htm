<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i001.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once upon a time two little puppies were born
on the very same day. Of course that made them
twins! One day when they were quite small,
Jimmy’s father brought them home in a big
basket. Their backs were turned to each other.
One big, black eye was sticking out over one side
of the basket, and two saucy brown ones over
the other side.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Daddy!” was all Jimmy could say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What shall we name them?” asked Daddy,
after he had laid the doggies on a pretty green
cushion by the fireplace. Jimmy turned his blue
eyes <i>way up</i>. He was trying to think.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the next yard a little girl was blowing
bubbles. The bubbles shown like the puppies’
eyes. “Let’s call the BROWN ONE BUBBLES!”
he said suddenly. “Fine!” answered Daddy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then he left his seat in the big arm-chair. The
black-eyed puppy had gotten off his cushion, and
was trying to chew Jimmy’s shoe! “Go back to
your cushion!” he commanded, “You’ll make a
lot of trouble, I can see!” “Oh, Daddy!” shouted
Jimmy. “Let’s call him TROUBLES!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>One evening Daddy came home with a package.
“Is it mine?” asked Jimmy. “It is for your twins,”
said Daddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Jimmy opened it, two nice, new collars
fell out! On one was a silver plate with
TROUBLES. On the other a silver plate with
BUBBLES.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Soon the puppies were very well trained. Every
morning Jimmy took them walking. <i>He</i> walked
in the middle. <i>Troubles</i> stayed on the outside,
while <i>Bubbles</i> was on the inside. They never
got out of line.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>But one morning, before Jimmy could turn,
they ran wildly across the street, barking furiously!
There on the other side was A BIG BLACK
CAT! Such a noise as they made! “Bow, Wow,
Bow, Wow, Bow, Wow! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
Bow-wow!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly the big, black cat arched her back
and hissed at them! “Meow! Meow! Meow!
Meow! P-f-f-f-f-f-f-f!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jimmy laughed and laughed when the twins
ran back pell-mell! He knew they were afraid.
“Fall in line!” he said, sternly. Then they marched
on down the street.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>One day Jimmy decided to be a circus man.
“I will have trained dogs!” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Daddy taught him some tricks. First they
got a big barrel-hoop. Troubles and Bubbles
did not want to jump through it at first, but
soon they learned how. Then they thought it
heaps of fun.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Soon they could do lots of tricks. They sat up
and begged. Bubbles could not hold his front
paws as gracefully as Troubles.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was so hard to teach them to walk! Bubbles
seemed to be bow-legged, and Troubles pigeon-toed,
but at last they succeeded in taking ten
steps at a time.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>And how beautifully they sang after a few lessons!
Troubles sang high and Bubbles sang low.</p>

<p class='c008'>But best of all they loved to play dead! They
lay so still when Jimmy covered them with an
old shawl, that sometimes it frightened him!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then Jimmy had a birthday. His father said
he might have a circus in the garage! They
trimmed it with flags and bunting, and fixed up
some soap boxes for a stage. Jimmy was so
thankful for such a nice father, that he gave him
a BIG HUG!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>At last it was time for the circus. All the boys
and girls in the neighborhood came. Jimmy
charged a penny admission. He wanted to buy a
gift for the little lame boy who lived in the alley.
He let him come in without paying anything.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>When the children were all in the garage Jimmy
closed the doors. Then he went to get the performers.
THEY WERE GONE! Jimmy looked
and looked but he could not find them. His
father looked and looked, but he could not find
them! His mother looked and looked, but she
could not find them! The children looked and
looked but they could not find them!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jimmy felt like crying, but he didn’t! Instead
he gave back a penny to each girl and boy who
had come to the circus. They all went home!
Only the little lame boy from the alley stayed.
He and Jimmy sat on the garage steps with their
faces in their hands and their elbows on their
knees. They were thinking.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!—Yip!—Yip!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jimmy looked at the lame boy. The lame
boy looked at Jimmy! “Where are they?” asked
Jimmy. “It sounds as if they’re in the garage,”
answered the lame boy. But when they got into
the garage it was EMPTY and VERY QUIET!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once more they went out and sat on the steps.
Soon they heard the crying noise again. Jimmy
called his father. Then they all listened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!—Yip!—Yip!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>It came from the corner where the automobile
stood. But when they went in to the car it was
EMPTY. Jimmy’s father was as much puzzled
as the boys. Soon they heard it again. “Yip!
Yip! Yip! Yip!” It was very weak.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Father laughed! Then he lifted up
the big front seat!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Huddled in the corner, frightened out of their
wits were the puppies! He lifted them out by
the back of their necks and placed them on the
hood. “You scamps!” he said, “You hid in
there while I was getting some tools, and I shut
you in because I did not see you!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Soon the children heard that the circus dogs
were found! They came rushing back with their
pennies! In a few minutes the garage was as
noisy as THE BIG TENT! Such clapping!
Such shouting! Such barking!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>When it was all over the children went home.
The little lame boy got his present. The puppies
had a good supper. Then Jimmy took them for a
nice long walk. Across the street was THE BIG
BLACK CAT!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>But the twins paid no attention to her. They
were too happy and full and sleepy.</p>
